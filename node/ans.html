      the event loop is responsible for basically running the code when a
      certain event occurs it's aware of all these callbacks and execute said
      code. it doesn't help with file operation though and it's important to
      understand that this operation is not handled by the event loop, just the
      callback that we might have defined on write file once it's done, that
      code will be handled in event loop but that code will finish fast, so
      basically the event loop will only handle callbacks that contain fast
      finishing code.
